            Hi, my name is Fayed. I am currently a sophomore at Rutgers University majoring in Bachelor of Science, Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. Asides from school, being a learning assistant, and interning, I like to build apps. Whether if it is a bot, website, etc., I have the interest to learn and build it, especially when I get to work with others.
